Secondary school students who enroll in the AFJROTC program are offered a wide variety of curricular and co-curricular activities. The program explores the historic and scientific aspects of aerospace technology and teaches high school students self-reliance, self-discipline and other leadership characteristics. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) concepts are also an important part of this world-class program. The AFJROTC program is open to 9th-12th grade students. This program is not chartered as a recruiting program for the military services and those students who participate in AFJROTC <bold>DO NOT</bold> ​incur any obligation to the Air Force.

 <h1>Curriculum</h1>
 <p>Aerospace science comprises 40 percent of the curriculum; leadership education, 40 percent; and health and wellness for life training, 20 percent. Classroom study includes the heritage of flight, principles of aircraft flight and navigation, human requirements of flight, development of aerospace power, aerospace vehicles, rocketry, space and technology programs, and the aerospace industry. Students are also introduced to military customs and courtesies, citizenship in the United States, first aid, wellness, health and fitness, basic drill and ceremonies, effective communications, management, human relations and life after high school. All uniforms and curriculum materials are provided by the Air Force.</p>
<p>To reinforce what is learned in the classroom, cadets participate in outside the classroom co-curricular activities such as field trips to military bases, aerospace facilities and industries, museums, civilian airports and other areas related to aerospace education. Cadets also participate in parades, leadership activities, drill team competitions, color  guards, military balls and honorary academic groups. </p>

<h1>Instructors</h1>
<p>All AFJROTC instructors are retired Air Force commissioned and non-commissioned officers. The instructors maintain Air Force standards and are trained through the AFJROTC Junior Instructor Certification Course. They are full-time faculty members of the participating high school and are employed by the local school board to teach AFJROTC classes. There are more than 1,900 instructors serving in over 880 units around the world.</p>
